    "- How do you solve it?\n",
    "- Could a computer do the same?\n",
    "- If so, could we go further? For example:\n",
    "  - Stitch together many natural scene images into one?\n",
    "  - Reconstruct a 3D model of a building from its 2D photos?\n",

    "\n",
    "We (humans) do it by **looking for unique patterns or features** that help us:\n",
