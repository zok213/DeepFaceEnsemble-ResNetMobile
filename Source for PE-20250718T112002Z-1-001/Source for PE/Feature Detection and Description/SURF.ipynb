Scale-Space Detection with Box Filters\n","\n","- Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) is **approximated** by a box filter\n","- **Box filters** are applied using **integral images** for fast computation\n","- **Hessian matrix** $ \\mathbf{H} $ is defined as:\n","\n","$$\n","\\mathbf{H}(x, y, \\sigma) =\n","\\begin{bmatrix}\n","L_{xx}(x, y, \\sigma) & L_{xy}(x, y, \\sigma) \\\\\n","L_{xy}(x, y, \\sigma) & L_{yy}(x, y, \\sigma)\n","\\end{bmatrix}\n","$$\n","\n","- **Determinant of the Hessian** is used to detect keypoints:\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{det}(\\mathbf{H}) = L_{xx}L_{yy} - (L_{xy})^2\n","$$\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. Orientation Assignment\n","\n","- **Wavelet responses** are computed in horizontal and vertical directions: $ dx $, $ dy $\n","- **Gaussian window** is applied to weight responses\n","- A **sliding orientation window** of $ 60^\\circ $ is used to determine the dominant orientation\n","- For speed, set `upright=True` to use **U-SURF** (no rotation invariance)\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. Feature Description\n","\n","- A square window of size $ 20s \\times 20s $ is centered at the keypoint  \n","  (where $ s $ is the **scale** of the keypoint)\n","- Window is divided into **4×4 subregions**, totaling **16 regions**\n","- In each region, compute:\n","\n","  - $ \\sum dx $\n","  - $ \\sum dy $\n","  - $ \\sum |dx| $\n","  - $ \\sum |dy| $\n","\n","- Each subregion → 4 values → Total descriptor is:\n","\n","$$\n","16 \\text{ regions} \\times 4 = 64 \\text{ dimensions}\n","$$\n","\n","#### Extended Descriptor:\n","\n","- If `extended=True`, the descriptor becomes **128 dimensions** by separating positive and negative responses\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4.
