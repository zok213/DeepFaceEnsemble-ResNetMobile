Basic Idea\n","\n","- Select a pixel $ p $ in the image with intensity $ I_p $.\n","- Choose a **threshold** $ t $.\n","- Consider a **circle of 16 pixels** around $ p $.\n","\n","The pixel $ p $ is considered a **corner** if **there exists a set of 12 contiguous pixels** in the circle that are either:\n","\n","- All **brighter** than $ I_p + t $, or  \n","- All **darker** than $ I_p - t $\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. High-Speed Test\n","\n","To avoid unnecessary computation:\n","\n","- Test only pixels at positions **1, 9, 5, 13**.\n","- If at least **3 of them** are either all **brighter** or all **darker** than $ I_p $ by threshold $ t $, then apply the full segment test.\n","- Otherwise, **skip the pixel** ‚Äî it's **not a corner**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## üß† Machine Learning Optimization\n","\n","To further improve efficiency:\n","\n","- Use training images to analyze patterns around corners.\n","- For each 16-pixel circle, classify each pixel into one of 3 states:\n","  - Brighter than $ I_p + t $\n","  - Darker than $ I_p - t $\n","  - Similar to $ I_p $\n","\n","Represent the states as a **feature vector**, and use a **decision tree classifier (ID3)** to:\n","\n","- Choose the **optimal pixel positions** to test.\n","- **Minimize entropy** of the decision process.\n","- Build an efficient **decision tree** for fast corner detection.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ‚úÇÔ∏è Non-Maximum Suppression\n","\n","**Problem**: Multiple keypoints are detected very close together.\n","\n","**Solution**: Use **non-maximum suppression**.\n","\n","- Compute a **corner score** $ S $ for each keypoint:\n","\n","$$\n","S = \\sum_{i=1}^{16} |I_i - I_p|\n","$$\n","\n","Where:\n","- $ I_i $: intensity of surrounding pixel $ i $\n","- $ I_p $: intensity of the center pixel\n","\n","- Compare scores of adjacent keypoints.\n","- Keep only the one with the **highest score** $ S $.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## ‚úÖ Summary of FAST\n","\n","| Feature      | Description                                 |\n","|--------------|---------------------------------------------|\n","| üîÑ Speed      | Extremely fast compared to SIFT/SURF        |\n","| ‚ö†Ô∏è Weakness   | Sensitive to noise and threshold             |\n","| üí° Strength   | Excellent for real-time applications         |\n","| üìâ Limitation | No scale or rotation invariance             |\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_ASsizjn9Qfv"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"2u_CLnqx8OBR"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import cv2 as cv\n","from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n","\n","# Load image\n","img = cv.imread('blox.jpg', cv.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)\n","\n","# Create FAST detector object\n","fast = cv.FastFeatureDetector_create()\n","\n","# Detect keypoints with nonmaxSuppression = True\n","kp = fast.detect(img, None)\n","img_keypoints = cv.drawKeypoints(img, kp, None, color=(255, 0, 0))\n","\n","# Display info\n","print(\"Threshold:\", fast.getThreshold())\n","print(\"nonmaxSuppression:\", fast.getNonmaxSuppression())\n","print(\"Neighborhood type:\", fast.getType())\n","print(\"Keypoints with nonmaxSuppression:\", len(kp))\n","\n","# Detect keypoints with nonmaxSuppression = False\n","fast.setNonmaxSuppression(False)\n","kp2 = fast.detect(img, None)\n","img_keypoints2 = cv.drawKeypoints(img, kp2, None, color=(255, 0, 0))\n","print(\"Keypoints without nonmaxSuppression:\", len(kp2))\n","\n","# Show results using matplotlib\n","plt.figure(figsize=(18, 6))\n","\n","plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)\n","plt.title(\"Original Image (Grayscale)\")\n","plt.imshow(img, cmap='gray')\n","plt.axis('off')\n","\n","plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)\n","plt.title(\"With Nonmax Suppression\")\n","plt.imshow(cv.cvtColor(img_keypoints, cv.COLOR_BGR2RGB))\n","plt.axis('off')\n","\n","plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)\n","plt.title(\"Without Nonmax Suppression\")\n","plt.imshow(cv.cvtColor(img_keypoints2, cv.COLOR_BGR2RGB))\n","plt.axis('off')\n","\n","plt.tight_layout()\n","plt.show()\n"]}]}
